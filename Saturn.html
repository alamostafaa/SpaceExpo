                    Adorned with thousands of beautiful ringlets, Saturn is unique among the planets. It is not the only
                    planet to have rings – made of chunks of ice and rock – but none are as spectacular or as
                    complicated as

                        Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest planet in our solar system. Like
                        fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Saturn is
                        not the only planet to have rings, but none are as spectacular or as complex as Saturn's. Saturn
                        also has dozens of moons.

                        From the jets of water that spray from Saturn's moon Enceladus to the methane lakes on smoggy
                        Titan, the Saturn system is a rich source of scientific discovery and still holds many
                        mysteries.

                        The farthest planet from Earth discovered by the unaided human eye, Saturn has been known since
                        ancient times. The planet is named for the Roman god of agriculture and wealth, who was also the
                        father of Jupiter.

                    <p>
                        Saturn's environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures, and
                        materials that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms
                        to adapt to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While planet Saturn is an unlikely place for living things to take hold, the same is not true of
                        some of its many moons. Satellites like Enceladus and Titan, home to internal oceans, could
                        possibly support life.

                    <p>
                        With a radius of 36,183.7 miles (58,232 kilometers), Saturn is 9 times wider than Earth. If
                        Earth were the size of a nickel, Saturn would be about as big as a volleyball.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From an average distance of 886 million miles (1.4 billion kilometers), Saturn is 9.5
                        astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance
                        from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 80 minutes to travel from the Sun
                        to Saturn.

                    <p>
                        Saturn has the second-shortest day in the solar system. One day on Saturn takes only 10.7 hours
                        (the time it takes for Saturn to rotate or spin around once), and Saturn makes a complete orbit
                        around the Sun (a year in Saturnian time) in about 29.4 Earth years (10,756 Earth days).

                        Its axis is tilted by 26.73 degrees with respect to its orbit around the Sun, which is similar
                        to Earth's 23.5-degree tilt. This means that, like Earth, Saturn experiences seasons.

                        Saturn is home to a vast array of intriguing and unique worlds. From the haze-shrouded surface
                        of Titan to crater-riddled Phoebe, each of Saturn's moons tells another piece of the story
                        surrounding the Saturn system. Currently, Saturn has 53 confirmed moons with 29 additional
                        provisional moons awaiting confirmation.

                    <p>
                        Saturn's rings are thought to be pieces of comets, asteroids, or shattered moons that broke up
                        before they reached the planet, torn apart by Saturn's powerful gravity. They are made of
                        billions
                        of small chunks of ice and rock coated with other materials such as dust. The ring particles
                        mostly
                        range from tiny, dust-sized icy grains to chunks as big as a house. A few particles are as large
                        as
                        mountains. The rings would look mostly white if you looked at them from the cloud tops of
                        Saturn,
                        and interestingly, each ring orbits at a different speed around the planet.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Saturn's ring system extends up to 175,000 miles (282,000 kilometers) from the planet, yet the
                        vertical height is typically about 30 feet (10 meters) in the main rings. Named alphabetically
                        in
                        the order they were discovered, the rings are relatively close to each other, with the exception
                        of
                        a gap measuring 2,920 miles (4,700 kilometers) in width called the Cassini Division that
                        separates
                        Rings A and B. The main rings are A, B, and C. Rings D, E, F, and G are fainter and more
                        recently
                        discovered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Starting at Saturn and moving outward, there is the D ring, C ring, B ring, Cassini Division, A
                        ring, F ring, G ring, and finally, the E ring. Much farther out, there is the very faint Phoebe
                        ring
                        in the orbit of Saturn's moon Phoebe.

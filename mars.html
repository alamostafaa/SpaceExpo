                <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun – a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere.
                    Mars is also a dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence
                    that it was even more active in the past.</p>
                <p>Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet where we've
                    sent rovers to roam the alien landscape.</p>

                            A panoramic view of Pathfinder's Ares Vallis landing site, featured on the cover of the Dec. 5 issue of Science, reveals traces of this warmer, wetter past, showing a floodplain covered with a variety of rock types, boulders, rounded and semi-rounded cobbles and pebbles. These rocks and pebbles are thought to have been swept down and deposited by floods which occurred early in Mars' evolution in the Ares and Tiu regions near the Pathfinder landing site.

                        Mars is no place for the faint-hearted. It’s dry, rocky, and bitter cold. The fourth planet from
                        the
                        Sun, Mars is one of Earth's two closest planetary neighbors (Venus is the other). Mars is one of
                        the
                        easiest planets to spot in the night sky – it looks like a bright red point of light.</p>

                    <p>
                        Mars was named by the ancient Romans for their god of war because its reddish color was
                        reminiscent of
                        blood. Other civilizations also named the planet for this attribute – for example, the Egyptians
                        called
                        it "Her Desher," meaning "the red one." Even today, it is frequently called the "Red Planet"
                        because
                        iron minerals in the Martian dirt oxidize, or rust, causing the surface to look red.

                    <p>
                        Scientists don't expect to find living things currently thriving on Mars. Instead, they're
                        looking for
                        signs of life that existed long ago, when Mars was warmer and covered with water.

                    <h1>Size and Distance</h1>
                    <p>
                        With a radius of 2,106 miles (3,390 kilometers), Mars is about half the size of Earth. If Earth
                        were the
                        size of a nickel, Mars would be about as big as a raspberry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From an average distance of 142 million miles (228 million kilometers), Mars is 1.5 astronomical
                        units
                        away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to
                        Earth.
                        From this distance, it takes sunlight 13 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mars.

                    <h1>Orbit and Rotation</h1>
                    <p>
                        As Mars orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 24.6 hours, which is very similar to one
                        day on
                        Earth (23.9 hours). Martian days are called sols – short for "solar day." A year on Mars lasts
                        669.6
                        sols, which is the same as 687 Earth days.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mars' axis of rotation is tilted 25 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the
                        Sun. This
                        is another similarity with Earth, which has an axial tilt of 23.4 degrees. Like Earth, Mars has
                        distinct
                        seasons, but they last longer than seasons here on Earth since Mars takes longer to orbit the
                        Sun
                        (because it's farther away). And while here on Earth the seasons are evenly spread over the
                        year,
                        lasting 3 months (or one quarter of a year), on Mars the seasons vary in length because of Mars'
                        elliptical, egg-shaped orbit around the Sun.

                        Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, that may be captured asteroids. They're
                        potato-shaped
                        because they have too little mass for gravity to make them spherical.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The moons get their names from the horses that pulled the chariot of the Greek god of war, Ares.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Phobos, the innermost and larger moon, is heavily cratered, with deep grooves on its surface. It
                        is
                        slowly moving towards Mars and will crash into the planet or break apart in about 50 million
                        years.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Deimos is about half as big as Phobos and orbits two and a half times farther away from Mars.
                        Oddly-shaped Deimos is covered in loose dirt that often fills the craters on its surface, making
                        it
                        appear smoother than pockmarked Phobos.

                            On Oct. 9, NASA's Juno spacecraft flew past Earth, using our home planet's gravity to get the final boost it needed to reach Jupiter. The JunoCam instrument captured this monochrome view of Earth, and other instruments were tested to ensure they work as designed during a close planetary encounter.

                        Earth has a very hospitable temperature and mix of chemicals that have made life abundant here.
                        Most
                        notably, Earth is unique in that most of our planet is covered in liquid water, since the
                        temperature
                        allows liquid water to exist for extended periods of time. Earth's vast oceans provided a
                        convenient
                        place for life to begin about 3.8 billion years ago.

                        With a radius of 3,959 miles (6,371 kilometers), Earth is the biggest of the terrestrial planets
                        and the
                        fifth largest planet overall.

                        From an average distance of 93 million miles (150 million kilometers), Earth is exactly one
                        astronomical
                        unit away from the Sun because one astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from
                        the Sun
                        to Earth. This unit provides an easy way to quickly compare planets' distances from the Sun.

                    <p>
                        It takes about eight minutes for light from the Sun to reach our planet.

                        As Earth orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 23.9 hours. It takes 365.25 days to
                        complete
                        one trip around the Sun. That extra quarter of a day presents a challenge to our calendar
                        system, which
                        counts one year as 365 days. To keep our yearly calendars consistent with our orbit around the
                        Sun,
                        every four years we add one day. That day is called a leap day, and the year it's added to is
                        called a
                        leap year.

                    <p>
                        Earth's axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 degrees with respect to the plane of Earth's orbit
                        around the
                        Sun. This tilt causes our yearly cycle of seasons. During part of the year, the northern
                        hemisphere is
                        tilted toward the Sun, and the southern hemisphere is tilted away. With the Sun higher in the
                        sky, solar
                        heating is greater in the north producing summer there. Less direct solar heating produces
                        winter in the
                        south. Six months later, the situation is reversed. When spring and fall begin, both hemispheres
                        receive
                        roughly equal amounts of heat from the Sun.

                    <p>
                        Earth is the only planet that has a single moon. Our Moon is the brightest and most familiar
                        object in
                        the night sky. In many ways, the Moon is responsible for making Earth such a great home. It
                        stabilizes
                        our planet's wobble, which has made the climate less variable over thousands of years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Earth sometimes temporarily hosts orbiting asteroids or large rocks. They are typically trapped
                        by
                        Earth's gravity for a few months or years before returning to an orbit around the Sun. Some
                        asteroids
                        will be in a long “dance” with Earth as both orbit the Sun.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some moons are bits of rock that were captured by a planet's gravity, but our Moon is likely the
                        result
                        of a collision billions of years ago. When Earth was a young planet, a large chunk of rock
                        smashed into
                        it, displacing a portion of Earth's interior. The resulting chunks clumped together and formed
                        our Moon.
                        With a radius of 1,080 miles (1,738 kilometers), the Moon is the fifth largest moon in our solar
                        system
                        (after Ganymede, Titan, Callisto, and Io).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Moon is an average of 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers) away from Earth. That means 30
                        Earth-sized
                        planets could fit in between Earth and its Moon.

                    Earth has a very hospitable temperature and mix of chemicals that have made life abundant here. Most
                    notably, Earth is unique in that most of our planet is covered in liquid water, since the temperature
                    allows liquid water to exist for extended periods of time. Earth's vast oceans provided a convenient
                    place for life to begin about 3.8 billion years ago.

                    With a radius of 3,959 miles (6,371 kilometers), Earth is the biggest of the terrestrial planets and the
                    fifth largest planet overall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From an average distance of 93 million miles (150 million kilometers), Earth is exactly one astronomical
                    unit away from the Sun because one astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun
                    to Earth. This unit provides an easy way to quickly compare planets' distances from the Sun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It takes about eight minutes for light from the Sun to reach our planet.

                    <h1><span>Orbit</span> and Rotation</h1>
                <p>
                    As Earth orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 23.9 hours. It takes 365.25 days to complete
                    one trip around the Sun. That extra quarter of a day presents a challenge to our calendar system, which
                    counts one year as 365 days. To keep our yearly calendars consistent with our orbit around the Sun,
                    every four years we add one day. That day is called a leap day, and the year it's added to is called a
                    leap year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Earth's axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 degrees with respect to the plane of Earth's orbit around the
                    Sun. This tilt causes our yearly cycle of seasons. During part of the year, the northern hemisphere is
                    tilted toward the Sun, and the southern hemisphere is tilted away. With the Sun higher in the sky, solar
                    heating is greater in the north producing summer there. Less direct solar heating produces winter in the
                    south. Six months later, the situation is reversed. When spring and fall begin, both hemispheres receive
                    roughly equal amounts of heat from the Sun.

                <p>
                    Earth is the only planet that has a single moon. Our Moon is the brightest and most familiar object in
                    the night sky. In many ways, the Moon is responsible for making Earth such a great home. It stabilizes
                    our planet's wobble, which has made the climate less variable over thousands of years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Earth sometimes temporarily hosts orbiting asteroids or large rocks. They are typically trapped by
                    Earth's gravity for a few months or years before returning to an orbit around the Sun. Some asteroids
                    will be in a long “dance” with Earth as both orbit the Sun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some moons are bits of rock that were captured by a planet's gravity, but our Moon is likely the result
                    of a collision billions of years ago. When Earth was a young planet, a large chunk of rock smashed into
                    it, displacing a portion of Earth's interior. The resulting chunks clumped together and formed our Moon.
                    With a radius of 1,080 miles (1,738 kilometers), the Moon is the fifth largest moon in our solar system
                    (after Ganymede, Titan, Callisto, and Io).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Moon is an average of 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers) away from Earth. That means 30 Earth-sized
                    planets could fit in between Earth and its Moon.

                <p>Jupiter has a long history of surprising scientists – all the way back to 1610 when Galileo Galilei
                    found the first moons beyond Earth. That discovery changed the way we see the universe.</p>
                <p>
                    Fifth in line from the Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – more than
                    twice as massive as all the other planets combined.

                    Jupiter's familiar stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating
                    in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger
                    than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.

                        Jupiter is the fifth planet from our Sun and is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system
                        –
                        more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. Jupiter's stripes and swirls are
                        actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and
                        helium.
                        Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds
                        of
                        years.

                    <p>
                        Jupiter is surrounded by dozens of moons. Jupiter also has several rings, but unlike the famous
                        rings of Saturn, Jupiter’s rings are very faint and made of dust, not ice.

                    <p>
                        Jupiter’s environment is probably not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures,
                        pressures,
                        and materials that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for
                        organisms
                        to adapt to.

                    <p>
                        While planet Jupiter is an unlikely place for living things to take hold, the same is not true
                        of
                        some of its many moons. Europa is one of the likeliest places to find life elsewhere in our
                        solar
                        system. There is evidence of a vast ocean just beneath its icy crust, where life could possibly
                        be
                        supported.

                        With a radius of 43,440.7 miles (69,911 kilometers), Jupiter is 11 times wider than Earth. If
                        Earth
                        were the size of a nickel, Jupiter would be about as big as a basketball.

                        From an average distance of 484 million miles (778 million kilometers), Jupiter is 5.2
                        astronomical
                        units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun
                        to
                        Earth. From this distance, it takes Sunlight 43 minutes to travel from the Sun to Jupiter.

                        Jupiter has the shortest day in the solar system. One day on Jupiter takes only about 10 hours
                        (the
                        time it takes for Jupiter to rotate or spin around once), and Jupiter makes a complete orbit
                        around
                        the Sun (a year in Jovian time) in about 12 Earth years (4,333 Earth days).

                        Its equator is tilted with respect to its orbital path around the Sun by just 3 degrees. This
                        means
                        Jupiter spins nearly upright and does not have seasons as extreme as other planets do.

                        With four large moons and many smaller moons, Jupiter forms a kind of miniature solar system.
                        Jupiter has 53 confirmed moons and 26 provisional moons awaiting confirmation of discovery.
                        Moons
                        are named after they are confirmed.

                        Jupiter's four largest moons – Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto – were first observed by the
                        astronomer Galileo Galilei in 1610 using an early version of the telescope. These four moons are
                        known today as the Galilean satellites, and they're some of the most fascinating destinations in
                        our
                        solar system. Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system. Ganymede is the
                        largest
                        moon in the solar system (even bigger than the planet Mercury). Callisto’s very few small
                        craters
                        indicate a small degree of current surface activity. A liquid-water ocean with the ingredients
                        for
                        life may lie beneath the frozen crust of Europa, making it a tempting place to explore.

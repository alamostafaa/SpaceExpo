                    The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger than
                    Earth's Moon.

                <p>
                    From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when
                    viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its proximity
                    to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that title belongs to nearby
                    Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because of Mercury's elliptical – egg-shaped – orbit, and sluggish rotation, the Sun appears to rise
                    briefly, set, and rise again from some parts of the planet's surface. The same thing happens in
                    reverse at sunset.

                            On March 18, 2011, MESSENGER made history by becoming the first spacecraft ever to orbit
                            Mercury. Eleven days later, the spacecraft captured the first image ever obtained from
                            Mercury orbit, shown here on the left.

                        The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger
                        than Earth's Moon. From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as
                        large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mercury's surface temperatures are both extremely hot and cold. Because the planet is so close
                        to the Sun, day temperatures can reach highs of 800°F (430°C). Without an atmosphere to retain
                        that heat at night, temperatures can dip as low as -290°F (-180°C).

                        Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that
                        title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere. But Mercury is the fastest
                        planet, zipping around the Sun every 88 Earth days.

                    <p>
                        Mercury's environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures and solar
                        radiation that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme for organisms to adapt to.

                    <p>
                        With a radius of 1,516 miles (2,440 kilometers), Mercury is a little more than 1/3 the width of
                        Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mercury would be about as big as a blueberry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From an average distance of 36 million miles (58 million kilometers), Mercury is 0.4
                        astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance
                        from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 3.2 minutes to travel from the Sun
                        to Mercury.

                    <h1>Orbit and Rotation</h1>
                    <p>
                        Mercury's highly eccentric, egg-shaped orbit takes the planet as close as 29 million miles (47
                        million kilometers) and as far as 43 million miles (70 million kilometers) from the Sun. It
                        speeds around the Sun every 88 days, traveling through space at nearly 29 miles (47 kilometers)
                        per second, faster than any other planet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mercury spins slowly on its axis and completes one rotation every 59 Earth days. But when
                        Mercury is moving fastest in its elliptical orbit around the Sun (and it is closest to the Sun),
                        each rotation is not accompanied by sunrise and sunset like it is on most other planets. The
                        morning Sun appears to rise briefly, set, and rise again from some parts of the planet's
                        surface. The same thing happens in reverse at sunset for other parts of the surface. One Mercury
                        solar day (one full day-night cycle) equals 176 Earth days – just over two years on Mercury.
